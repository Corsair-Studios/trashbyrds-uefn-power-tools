0. Self-syncs this bridge copy from the newest project copy on disk (see

"""

# ── 0. Self-sync from the newest project copy (BEFORE any bridge import) ───
# WHY THIS EXISTS: UEFN executes the bridge from an ENGINE-SIDE copy
# (...\FortniteGame\Content\Python\) that does NOT reliably pick up a newer
# copy the extension re-staged into the user's project Content\Python —
# confirmed stale on a real machine even after a full PC reboot. The engine
# dir IS writable by the bridge itself (tools already write logs there), so
# on every load we check whether a newer project copy exists on disk and, if
# so, copy it over ourselves — self-healing with no manual "reinstall" step.
#
# WHY REGISTRY-FREE: this runs at plugin-load time, before UEFN's Asset
# Registry is guaranteed ready, so we can't ask Unreal where the project
# lives (the asset-anchored trick health_scanner/asset_usage use later, once
# the registry is up). Instead we glob the well-known default install
# locations directly.
#
# WHY BEFORE ANY OTHER IMPORT: everything below this block — uefn_bridge,
# menu wiring, uefn_launcher on demand — must load the FRESHLY COPIED code
# in THIS SAME editor session. If sync ran after other bridge modules had
# already imported, Python's sys.modules cache would keep serving the stale
# versions for the rest of the session regardless of what's now on disk.
#
# WHY "NEWEST" WINS: the bridge is project-agnostic — the same engine-side
# copy serves whichever UEFN project happens to be open — so if more than
# one project on this machine carries the bridge, the newest stamp is the
# most recent extension install/update and is what should be running.

             open/read) for every name present on both sides. Any size
             mismatch is an immediate True.
          3. Only for names whose sizes MATCH do we hash actual bytes
             (sha1, read in chunks) -- this is the one case size alone
             cannot rule out (two different files that happen to share a

        Failure modes of this strategy: none that produce a false
        "identical" verdict for genuinely different files -- step 3 always
        hashes full contents (not a prefix/sample) whenever size alone is
        inconclusive, so a same-size-different-bytes file is always caught.
        The only way this returns False incorrectly is a genuine SHA-1

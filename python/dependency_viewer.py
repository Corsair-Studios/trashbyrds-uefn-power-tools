"""
UEFN Asset Dependency Viewer
=============================
Visualize dependency chains between project assets — what depends on what,
find orphaned assets, and identify heavy dependency chains.  Runs inside
UEFN's embedded Python 3.11 (requires the ``unreal`` module).

Provides two interfaces:
  1. **scan_dependencies()**      — Asset Registry scan; returns structured dict
  2. **show_dependency_viewer()** — Tkinter UI with hierarchical treeview,
                                    live filter, orphan highlight, sort, and
                                    interactive visual dependency graph

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

def scan_dependencies(project_only=True):
    """
    Scan the Asset Registry to build a full dependency graph for project assets.

    For each asset, ``get_dependencies()`` is called to learn what it depends
    on (outgoing edges).  The reverse map (incoming / referencers) is derived
    from the forward map.

    Enumeration (project_only=True, the path the UI always uses): PATH-scoped
    — every asset under the detected project prefix is included regardless
    of class (Blueprints, sounds, animations, data assets, level sequences,
    widgets, textures, materials, meshes, …), not a fixed class allow-list.
    Each asset's displayed ``type`` is derived from its own registry class
    data (see ``_asset_type_label``). (project_only=False is an explicit
    opt-in to an unscoped scan and keeps the original fixed-class behaviour
    — see the branch below.)

    Parameters
    ----------
    project_only : bool
        When True (default) the scan is scoped to the detected project
        prefix — see ``_detect_project_scope``. If the prefix cannot be
        CONFIDENTLY resolved, the scan is refused outright (returns
        ``scan_failed=True``) rather than silently enumerating every mounted
        asset (Fortnite content included) or reporting an empty result that
        would read as "clean project".

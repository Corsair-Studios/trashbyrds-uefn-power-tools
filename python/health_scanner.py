UEFN Project Health Scanner
============================
Scans the project's Content directory on disk for common file-health issues:
zero-byte assets, oversized files, invalid filenames, duplicate names,
excessively deep paths, and stale (unmaintained) assets.

Runs inside UEFN's embedded Python 3.11 (requires the ``unreal`` module).

Provides these interfaces:
  1. **_get_project_root()**   — walk up from __file__ to find .uefnproject root
  2. **_resolve_scan_root()**  — location-independent, self-validating Content
                                 dir resolution (see below)
  3. **scan_health()**         — disk scan; returns structured results dict
  4. **show_health_scanner()** — Tkinter UI with flat issue list and live filter

Scan-root resolution (``_resolve_scan_root``)
----------------------------------------------
UEFN COPIES the project's ``Content/Python`` into the embedded engine
install (``.../FortniteGame/Content/Python/``) and EXECUTES scripts FROM
THERE. That means plain ``__file__``-anchored filesystem walkup is not
reliably sufficient to find the user's real island project — depending on
which copy of this script is currently running, the walkup either
correctly fails (the install tree has no ``.uefnproject``) or, if a naive
fallback is trusted unconditionally, resolves to the FortniteGame install
tree and maps every real island asset to a "ghost". ``_resolve_scan_root``
tries several candidates (filesystem walkup, an unreal-API asset anchor,
default project locations, the validated ``unreal.Paths`` resolver) and
only trusts a candidate once it is validated against real registry assets
found on disk.

    # on its MAIN THREAD (see the tick pump a few dozen lines down, and the
    # Tk resize-storm precedent in dependency_viewer.py:1749-1802 —
    # heavy/misbehaving Tk work executed synchronously from that callback
    # runs mid-frame on UEFN's own thread, not some isolated Python UI
    # loop, and previously aborted the whole host process). <Motion> fires
    # on EVERY mouse pixel — far more often than <Configure> during a
    # resize — so without both fixes, dragging across a row would
    # destroy() and recreate a tk.Toplevel dozens of times per second
    # inside that same undeferrable callback. Do NOT "simplify" this back

"""
UEFN Bridge — File-based IPC for MCP Server
=============================================
Runs inside UEFN's embedded Python 3.11. Provides file-based IPC so an
external MCP server can send commands and receive responses.

Polls the legacy ``command.json`` file AND any per-command
``command_{id}.json`` inbox files (see bridge_paths.COMMAND_PREFIX) for
incoming requests, executes them using the ``unreal`` API, and writes
results to ``response_{id}.json``.  Also emits a ``heartbeat.json`` every
~5 seconds, which carries a per-session token that a command must echo
back (cheap partial isolation against a stale/unrelated MCP server writing
into a shared temp dir — not full auth; see the ``_bridge_token`` comment
below) and this bridge's version, so a TS client can tell whether it's safe
to write a per-command inbox file instead of the single shared
``command.json``.

IPC directory: ``.uefn_bridge/`` (next to this script)

Usage:
    import importlib, uefn_bridge; importlib.reload(uefn_bridge)

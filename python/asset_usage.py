"""
UEFN Shared Asset-Usage / Orphan Confirmation
=============================================
Authoritative "is this asset truly unreferenced?" check shared by the material,
texture, and Niagara browsers. Uses the Asset Registry REVERSE reference graph
(get_referencers) across ALL asset types, plus a Verse source-text cross-check,
mirroring dependency_viewer.py's proven logic.

WHY THIS EXISTS: walking the currently-loaded level's actors only sees that ONE
level. It is blind to other levels/islands, devices' @editable asset references,
Verse scripts, material-instance parent materials, decals, UI, landscape, and
soft references. Flagging an asset "unused" from a level-walk alone can falsely
mark in-use assets as deletable. This module is the safety net: a candidate is
only confirmed orphaned when NOTHING anywhere references it.

Public API:
    confirm_orphans(candidate_paths, project_only=True, registry=None) -> dict
        {path: reason} for candidates with NO project references (registry
        referencers + Verse source text). Paths ABSENT from the result ARE
        referenced and must NOT be flagged as unused. UNCHANGED signature and
        behavior — kept for existing callers (asset_sweep, niagara_inspector,
        material_browser, texture_finder). Internally now built on top of
        confirm_orphans_detailed() below and is slightly MORE conservative
        than before: a candidate whose registry check errored used to be
        silently treated as "no referencers" and could be flagged orphaned;
        it is now tiered "unknown" and excluded from this result instead
        (never reported as unused when a check failed to run).
    confirm_orphans_detailed(candidate_paths, project_only=True, registry=None,
                              max_referencers=10, max_verse_matches=5) -> dict
        ADDITIVE. {path: {tier, reason, registry_checked,
        registry_referencers, registry_referencer_count,
        registry_referencers_capped, verse_checked, verse_matches,
        verse_matches_capped}} for EVERY candidate examined (not just
        orphans). tier is one of "referenced", "referenced_verse",
        "likely_unused", "unknown" — see the function docstring.
    get_referencer_details(pkg, project_only=True, registry=None) -> list[str]
        Project referencer package paths for one asset (for "who uses this").
        UNCHANGED.
    load_verse_source_text() -> str
        UNCHANGED. Concatenated, lowercased Verse source text (or "" if the
        scan is unavailable this run).
    load_verse_source_files() -> list[dict]
        ADDITIVE per-file accessor: [{"path": <relative path>, "text":
        <lowercased content>}, ...] — same underlying scan/cache as
        load_verse_source_text(), just not flattened, so callers can report
        WHICH file matched.
    verse_scan_available() -> bool
        ADDITIVE. True if the Verse scan actually ran this process (project
        root resolved), False if it could not run at all. Lets callers tell
        "checked, found nothing" apart from "could not check".
